  "body": "### ### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n转眼，认识大半年。回首，又哭又笑。今天，也是结束的一天。过了今天，以后就是苦逼的码农生活，和以前 Say Bye-Bye。\r\n经此图纪念\r\n![](http://a2.qpic.cn/psb?/V14YvqeT0IzDJf/4Hp.KzdfTNx7itaqbyQEqCsZ7jXP2ZQfJqj*jN49dJs!/b/dH4BAAAAAAAA&bo=gAJyBAAAAAADB9Y!&rf=viewer_4)\r\n最后，让我们向最闪耀之星许下心愿，迎接 2016。",
